        The <u>canActivate router</u> guard is responsible for controlling access to specific routes in our app. 
        It ensures that only authorized users can access certain pages. You can find its implementation in the <u>auth.guard.ts</u> 
        file inside the <u>route-guard/guards folder.</u> Happy learning!
